# Project Name

## Live Demo
You can view the live demo of the project here: [Simbian Showcase](https://simbian-showcase.vercel.app/)

## Description
This project was created by following the guidelines provided in a shared video. The goal was to build a dynamic and responsive UI using React, while implementing smooth animations and scroll functionality. The project consists of multiple sections, each with and without Simbian elements, and dummy data was used for initial testing. The data was externalized into a context for better separation and maintainability.

## Thought Process
I began by analyzing the shared video and then proceeded to build the UI. I created separate sections with and without Simbian elements, initially using dummy data. These sections were later combined into a single page with different sections, ensuring proper structure. The data was then externalized into context for easier management.

To enhance the visual experience, I used ChatGPT to generate a background image and then incorporated **Framer Motion** (motion/react) for animations. Once the animations were added, I focused on ensuring the responsiveness of the layout. After implementing the scroll functionality, I deployed the project to Vercel.

## Animation Library Used
The animations in this project were implemented using **Framer Motion** (motion/react). This was my first time using the library, and I found it to be an engaging and efficient way to add animations to the UI.

## Known Issues & Improvements
- **UI Design**: The overall UI can be improved in terms of visual appeal. There's potential to enhance the design with more polished elements.
- **Mobile Performance**: On mobile devices, there's some lag when scrolling, which needs further investigation to optimize performance.
- **Icons**: Some icons may not be used as intended, which could be fixed with more attention to detail.
- **Animations**: The animations do not exactly replicate the ones in the reference video, but I have made efforts to come close. With more time, I can refine them to better match the original design.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js** for UI components.
- **Framer Motion** for animations.
- **Vercel** for deployment.

## Future Improvements
- Refining the animations for better accuracy.
- Optimizing performance, especially on mobile devices.
- Improving the overall design and ensuring consistent icon usage.

## Deployment
The project has been deployed on Vercel and is available for public access.
